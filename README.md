Hey, I'm Ark, or Will if you prefer a real actual name. I'm currently at BCIT for computer systems, so most of what gets posted here will be assignment code and stuff. If you need to reach me for some reason, your best bet is my discord, @Ark#7964.

Eventually, I want to get into game development, and when I work on private projects related to that I'll probably put them up here too.

Have fun poking around my code! (Some of it is a little rough, but that's the way it goes when you're learning!)
