Hey, I'm Ark, or Will if you prefer a real actual name. I'm currently a BCIT Computer Science student, and most of what I've put up here is assignment code, though occasionally I use it for personal project work as well. If you need to reach me for some reason, your best bet is my discord, @Arkangel964

I'm getting into game development, and when I work on private projects related to that I'll probably put them up here too.

Have fun poking around my code! (Some of it is a little rough, but that's the way it goes when you're learning!)
